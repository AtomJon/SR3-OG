Android alone underground in a apocolyptic world

alone and in the dark, wrecked underground, holes everywhere, rust and the such
exploring slowly as part of the tutorial

around 30 min of tutorial part
you get to the control room of the underground facility
press a button
that opens the main doors, the only one working at all
while you go towards the exit, make it jump in your eyes a single scheleton with a gun and some sort of message like
"the world has gone to shet, but no matter how bad is outside, dont let the evil within this place ever go free"
then you casually ignore it, take the gun, go outside and the sun shines on you
and a beast appears the game frezees and tells you to shoot. It's empty, the beast hears the click sound
and charges and you parkour your way out of there.
and the writting in some kind of green-ish paint
to make a refence how he wanted to get away but didnt want to leave the facility
doing a suicide after writting the message
and leaving the gun empty, implying it was the last bullet

you scan the beast, finding it's weaknesses and stores it in memory

Main Character(mc) is an S3R-OG = (type and creator) Series 3 Robot - Ophan Gengan

ok so, you find "yourself" in that room, with parts and broken robots in wrecked boxes,
a bp/picture on the wall with name and details of the structure
at the back of the room you find the R.S.T.  device - (R)obotic (S)tructural (T)ransfiguration
device where you can see it fully and change parts
progress a bit from the starting point, see different rooms with stuff, one of them is where droids like you were stored,
you learn about yourself there and the functions and find the first RST device, to customise

connect to an console to see the log, where you find the "Anomaly found, initialising ai" On a screen

A.S.G. - U.S.  = Automated Safety Guard - Universal security (type)

"the ASGUS, ahh, the basic stupid security bot. Their only fuction is to shoot first, ask never when they see someone in their database that is hostile,
or if the owner is smart, anyone who they see holding anything in the shape of a gun"

U start as a dumb robot but through the game you can collect forgotten files loaded into hard drives
They may contain memories of the human the robot used to be, restore former you and learn skills
